    <div class="author-description">
        Eliezer Wiesel was a Romania-born American novelist, political activist, and Holocaust survivor of Hungarian Jewish descent. He was the author of over 40 books, the best known of which is Night, a memoir that describes his experiences during the Holocaust and his imprisonment in several concentration camps.Wiesel was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986. The Norwegian Nobel Committee called him a &#34;messenger to mankind,&#34; noting that through his struggle to come to terms with &#34;his own personal experience of total humiliation and of the utter contempt for humanity shown in Hitler&#39;s death camps,&#34; as well as his &#34;practical work in the cause of peace,&#34; Wiesel has delivered a powerful message &#34;of peace, atonement and human dignity&#34; to humanity.On November 30, 2006 Wiesel received an honorary knighthood in London, England in recognition of his work toward raising Holocaust education in the United Kingdom.http://us.macmillan.com/author/eliewi...
